### When to use let or const?✨

N.B: As a general rule, you should always declare variables with const, if you realize that  
the value of the variable needs to change, go back and change it to let. Use let when you know that the value of a variable will change. Use const for every other variable. <br /><br />

> Examples of const:

```
const OUR_PLANET = 'Earth';
const PI = 3.14159;
const E = 2.71828;
```
